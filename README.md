# EigenGov

EigenGov is a system of people, products, and processes designed to support the long-term growth of the EigenLayer ecosystem by progressively decentralizing control of the protocol, tokens, and treasury. 

EigenGov is designed to address both immediate and future governance needs through a dual-track approach: Core and Vision. The goal is to develop a platform that is simultaneously minimal, secure, and stable, while also fostering radical innovation and experimentation.
* **Core** is like the stable software branch in production. Core is designed to be secure, simple, and predictable. It is responsible for ensuring EigenGov runs smoothly and is capture resistant. 
* **Vision** is like an experimental software branch under development. Decentralization is often a tradeoff with efficiency, and Vision seeks to minimize these tradeoffs and expand the benefits of decentralization. It balances pushing the boundaries of governance design while generating validated specifications that it proposes to Core.
