# EigenGov

EigenGov is a system of people, products, and processes designed to support the long-term reliability and growth of the EigenLayer protocol and ecosystem.

The role of EigenGov is to maintain a coordination layer for the EigenLayer ecosystem of EIGEN holders, AVS developers, operators, and stakers who are key participants in the prosperity, security, and reliability of the EigenLayer protocol. EigenGov brings our ecosystem participants together to support our common vision of open innovation through a novel system designed to be both effective and decentralized. 

EigenGov is based on a highly-collaborative network of small, sovereign teams called Councils, who are authorized to make key decisions on behalf of the ecosystem. All Councils are held accountable to community-legitimate, transparency-balanced participation via public proposal and review processes.
