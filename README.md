# EigenGov

EigenGov is a system of people, products, and processes designed to support the long-term reliability and growth of the EigenLayer protocol and ecosystem. It's based on a highly-collaborative network of small, sovereign teams called Councils, who are authorized to make key decisions on behalf of the ecosystem. All Councils are held accountable to community-legitimate, transparency-balanced participation via public proposal and review processes.

The role of EigenGov is to maintain a coordination layer for the stakeholders who contribute to the prosperity, security, and reliability of the EigenLayer protocol. EigenGov brings the ecosystem of EIGEN holders, AVS developers, operators, and stakers together together to support the project's common vision of open innovation through a novel system designed to be both effective and decentralized.
