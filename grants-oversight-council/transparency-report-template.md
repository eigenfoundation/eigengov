*A Transparency Report outlines a Grants Team’s retrospective on initiative grant allocations distributed in the season.*

*The Transparency Report will have two versions of the same report to allow for the exclusion of information that may not yet be ready for public announcement.*

1. *A public and redacted version published by the Grants Oversight Council which provides the EigenLayer community with an overview of the progress of the grants process.*  
2. *A private version submitted by the Grants Team directly to the Grants Oversight Council which includes more detailed information about specific grant awards.*
